#Front end localhost Navy Memorial

To properly run this program, it should create a datbase for you if it doesn't find one. 
If for some reason it does not, create a mysql database named 'country_db'

NPM START is all you should need to type in for both files to start the servers. 

To have it show any data of value, register a new user. Login as that user and 
then enter some countries, a visted or not visited value, and a date. It should then 
display in the login and also on the home page in the "Ports and Countries Visted" section.

Also, click the hyperlinks to see places that I have been stationed.
